Here are all the codes needed to compute the 4 figures of the replicated article. Their names are self-explanatory: for example `Figure1.py` creates the Figure 1, as described in the original article.

The scripts were implemented on Python (version 3.6.3), with the Numpy (version 1.14.0) and Matplotlib (version 2.1.1) libraries. They were implemented and ran on Mac OS, and we were also able to run them on Ubuntu, with Python 2.7.12, Numpy 1.13.3 and Matplotlib 2.1.0.
